✓ Logging gated behind debug flag (globalThis.__CFP_DEBUG)
✓ Removed console/print/type checks
✓ No Gtk imports in extension.js (shell process)
✓ No spawn commands (GNOME Shell APIs only)
✓ Reduced redundant typeof === 'function' guards (using optional chaining)
✓ Reduced unnecessary try/catch wrappers
