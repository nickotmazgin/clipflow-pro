# Archived Internal Notes

The files in this directory contain deep-dive research, AI session transcripts, and historical testing checklists that are still valuable for reference but no longer need to live alongside the day-to-day developer docs.

Nothing in here is required to build or run ClipFlow Pro; skim the filenames to find the topic you need.  If you generate new background material that feels similarly long-form, please drop it here so the primary `docs/` folder stays concise.
